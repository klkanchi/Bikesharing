# Bikesharing

**An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau**
## Overview

This Tableau story can be seen, in its entirety, at this link.

The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

    Who uses bikeshare programs?
    What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
    What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
    How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results

While the demographics of Des Moines may be different from the make up of the citizenry of NYC, a cursory look at the makeup of CitiBike riders may shine light on who bikeshare might appeal to, regardless of locale.

In the above image we can see that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

The above map displays the bike stations from which recorded bike trips started. The size of the circles and darkness of the green indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. It is apparent that the bulk of the bike trips are originating in the bustling commercial heart of Lower Manhattan, known for towering office buildings, densely packed residential skyscrapers, and entertainment venues. Bike usage is lower in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.





This graphing of number of trips by duration show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. More specifically, most trips are under a half-hour in length, with a swift dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.
